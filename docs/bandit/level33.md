    Congratulations on solving the last level of this game!

    At this moment, there are no more levels to play in this game. However, we are constantly working
    on new levels and will most likely expand this game with more levels soon.
    Keep an eye out for an announcement on our usual communication channels!
    In the meantime, you could play some of our other wargames.

    If you have an idea for an awesome new level, please let us know!

That's it. It was quite fun, I learned some useful things (how to use `find`, and how to do some things such as applying rot13 and doing TCP connections purely in bash scripts).
