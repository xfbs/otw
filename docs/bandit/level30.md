Well, git repositories seem to be quite popular. I do the same spiel again.

    bandit30@bandit:/tmp/tmp.ncBHJehwXo/repo$ ls
    README.md
    bandit30@bandit:/tmp/tmp.ncBHJehwXo/repo$ cat README.md 
    just an epmty file... muahaha

Okay, so there is no information here. I check to see if there is anything in
the logs or data associated with this commit.

Negative. Next I check for branches and tags.

	bandit30@bandit:/tmp/tmp.ncBHJehwXo/repo$ git branch -a
	* master
	  remotes/origin/HEAD -> origin/master
	  remotes/origin/master
	bandit30@bandit:/tmp/tmp.ncBHJehwXo/repo$ git tag
	secret

This seems promising â€” there are no other branches to speak of, but there is a
tag named *secret*. Can I check it out?

	bandit30@bandit:/tmp/tmp.ncBHJehwXo/repo$ git checkout secret
	fatal: reference is not a tree: secret

Seems like I can't. Now, a tag in git is simply a name for a SHA1 hash. So,
what if the hash it points to is the actual secret? I retrieve it.

	bandit30@bandit:/tmp/tmp.ncBHJehwXo/repo$ git show secret
	47e603bb428404d265f59c42920d81e5
	bandit30@bandit:/tmp/tmp.ncBHJehwXo/repo$

Just to be sure, I check if I can log in to the next level with this, and it
works, so this is it.
